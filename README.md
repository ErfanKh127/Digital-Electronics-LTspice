# Electronics Simulations in LTspice

A comprehensive collection of **LTspice simulations** exploring fundamental electronic circuits—from nanoscale CMOS digital gates to analog BJT amplifiers.

This repository serves as a hands-on learning resource for electronics students and hobbyists, featuring practical schematics, transient/DC/AC analyses, and educational insights.

## Key Topics Covered
- **Digital CMOS Circuits**:
  - CMOS Inverter (65nm BSIM4 models)
  - Resistive-load NMOS Inverter (historical comparison)
- **Diode Circuits**:
  - Biased shunt clipper
- **Single-Transistor Amplifiers**:
  - Common Emitter (CE) with voltage divider bias and emitter bypass
- **Multi-Transistor Topologies**:
  - Cascode Amplifier (high bandwidth)
  - Differential Amplifier (long-tailed pair)
  - Darlington Pair (ultra-high current gain)

Each simulation includes ready-to-run `.asc` files, detailed READMEs explaining circuit operation, expected results, and experiments to try.
